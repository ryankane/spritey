# Spritely Attributions 

Thanks to everyone who was directly or indirectly involved in this project to make it possible, including:

- **[Peter Severin](https://github.com/wiresketch)** for giving us a free open-source developer license for his wireframe and mockup tool called [WireframeSketcher](http://wireframesketcher.com/about.html).
- **[Github](https://github.com)** for making such a great social network for programmers and providing free hosting services to open-source projects.
- The developers of **[Eclipse](http://eclipse.org)** for creating such a great platform. Without it there would be no Spritey! ;)
